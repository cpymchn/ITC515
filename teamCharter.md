## Charter | Team 3 ITC515
Draft 002: July 21, 2015

#### Team Members
* Andrew M.
* Mark B.

#### Purpose
This team has come together to complete the requirements for ITC515 with the following intentions:

* to learn how to function as a team in a software development environment
* to participate in code reviews, testing, and debugging to the benefit of the overall project and to learn from each other in those contexts
* IN SHORT: colloborate and make better software

#### Vision

* we want to make great software... on time... on budget... but most importantly (in the context of ITC515) we want to do so in the most effiecient way possible.

#### Values

* we value expertise and experience [we can learn from each other as much as we can learn from the material]
* we value mutual respect and listening [it is OK to not know or understand]
* we value frequent communication [life happens, manage expectations through communication]
* we value timeliness [missing deadlines hurts us all]
* we value decisiveness [make decisions, make mistakes, learn from it, move on]
* we value collaboration and peer review [we like formal/structured processes]

#### Goals

* Our aim is to understand how to properly implement a software QA process so that shipping time decreases and refactoring in later versions is easy and obvious

#### Roles and Responsibilities

* We will split the work evenly
* We will all act as pseudo developers
* We will all manage the project administration tasks

#### Expectations

* We expect everyone to do their part
* We expect everyone to be courteous
* We expect everyone to stay in touch
 
#### Operating Procedures

##### Here are our ground rules for communication:

* Gmail and Google Hangouts
* Trello for project tracking
* Mark only checks email once a day
* We will use the wiki to communicate with Dr. Tulip

##### Here are our ground rules for making decisions:

* there are only two of us in the group at the moment, so it should be easy to confer on all major decisions

##### Here are our ground rules for meetings

* meet weekly as needed... we will change to fortnightly if warranted
* meet using Google Hangouts immediately after lecture
* agendas and minutes to be stored on GitHub
* TODO items will be captured in Trello

###### Here is how we expect to resolve conflicts

* talk first...if there is persistent or damaging disagreement then go to the professor 

###### Reflection

* we plan to reflect on performance after each assignment milestone
