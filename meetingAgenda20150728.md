#To Be Discussed at Meeting Two
* Assignment two is due August 28th.
* Three code reviews are required before that time.
* We need access to the code review tool before we can really do anything.

1. Discuss note taking at meetings. (see the marking criteria for the second assignment)
2. Discuss how much 'coding' we both need to do before the code reviews... what kind of 'level of effort' is required seeing how neither of us know java that well.
	* who and how do we divvy up the code base?
3. Discuss what needs to be accomplished in the next two week sprint. Record who will do what in the meeting minutes.
	* what tasks need to go into trello?
4. Discuss the requirement for three separate code reviews... "Participate effectively in at least 3 static code reviews, taking on the role of mediator, reviewer, and author at least once per role."
since there are only two of us....?
the professor is recommending we do these sequentially... what does that really mean in schedulling terms?
5. Does the below look good? should we move the schedule up or back? Should we add more padding in the submit/review/rework/approve cycle?

## Mark's suggested schedule... thoughts?:
* 08/09 [Sunday] Mark submits his code to Andrew
